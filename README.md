# resume

My current resume, which is a modified version of [`deedydas/Deedy-Resume`](https://github.com/deedydas/Deedy-Resume). GitHub Actions are configured to compile the LaTeX source into a PDF and publish it using [Cloudflare Pages Direct Uploads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/direct-upload/).
